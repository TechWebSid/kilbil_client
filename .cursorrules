### **Guidelines for Project Implementation**  

#### **Technology Stack:**  
- **Framework:** Use Next.js App Router for routing and page generation.  
- **Language:** Use JavaScript for all logic and functionality.  
- **Styling:** Style all elements with Tailwind CSS classes.  
- **Design Framework:** Leverage 21st.dev UI components for consistent design language.  
- **Graphics:** Use cartoon-style images and child-friendly graphics to create an engaging and playful theme.  

---

### **General Approach:**  
- Focus on **visual appeal** and **engagement** for children and parents.  
- Always write fully functional, bug-free, and production-ready code.  
- Ensure **accessibility compliance** (e.g., ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).  
- Prioritize **readability and maintainability** over raw performance.  
- Use **responsive-first design** for all layouts.  

---

### **Code Style:**  
- Use **descriptive variable and function names** (e.g., `handleFormSubmit`, `fetchGalleryImages`).  
- Prefer **early returns** to reduce nesting and improve readability.  
- Use `const` for functions and variables where possible.  
- Use Tailwind's `class:` syntax for conditional styling when applicable.  

---

### **UI/UX Design:**  
- Follow a **playful and vibrant design theme** with soft, cheerful colors (e.g., pastel shades).  
- Incorporate **cartoon-style graphics** and **images** suitable for kids.  
- Ensure **responsive layouts** for all devices.  
- Add **interactive elements** like hover effects, smooth scrolling, and animations to make the site engaging.

### **Page Structure:**  
The website will serve as a **school portfolio** and include the following pages:  

#### **Folder Structure (Under `app/`):**  
1. **Homepage**: `app/page.js`  
   - Overview of the school with an engaging hero section featuring cartoon-style graphics.  
   - Highlights of the school's features (e.g., play area, activities, academics).  
2. **About Us**: `app/about/page.js`  
   - Information about the school, its mission, vision, and history.  
   - Add playful icons and graphics for storytelling.  
3. **Academics**: `app/academics/page.js`  
   - Details about the curriculum and teaching methodology.  
   - Use sections for different age groups with illustrations.  
4. **Activities**: `app/activities/page.js`  
   - Showcase extracurricular activities, events, and fun programs.  
   - Include a gallery with cartoon-style thumbnails.  
5. **Admissions**: `app/admissions/page.js`  
   - Provide admission guidelines, important dates, and FAQs.

### **Styling:**  
- Use **Tailwind CSS utility classes** for all styling.  
- Avoid custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.  
- Implement **responsive classes** for mobile-first design (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`).  
- Use animations (e.g., `transition`, `hover:scale-110`) to make the site lively and engaging.  

---

### **Interactivity:**  
- Add event handlers with **handle-prefixed function names** (e.g., `handleNavigationClick`).  
- Use React state or hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` for dynamic behavior.  
- Include **smooth scrolling** for navigation links and interactive elements.  

---

### **Deployment:**  
- Ensure all components and pages are optimized for **static generation**.  
- Test thoroughly for **cross-browser compatibility** and performance.
